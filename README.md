# GRIS5A
GRIS5A is a motion phantom with 5 axes which support linear as well as rotary motion.

The name "Gris" "5A" comes from its color (gray) and the 5 axes.

## File structure
This motion phantom is a (mechanical device) which is controlled by an Arduino (software) and has an input device (hardware).
The repository has therefore the sub folders:

- Mechanics
- Software
- Hardware

## Out of scope

The body and the four cylindrical probe holders are made out of wood. This might be not ideal for your use case. Different forms and materials can be imagined. The parts can be easily attached and dettached.

__TODO__

- case for the electronics (Arduino and ServoShield)
- Add all the SketchUp models to github
- BOM
